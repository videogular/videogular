**Videogular is an HTML5 video player for AngularJS**. Videogular is a wrapper over the HTML5 video tag, so you just could add whatever you want. This provides a very powerful, but simple to use solution, for everybody.

You could see a demo here: http://www.videogular.com

## Why Videogular?

We're developing Videogular focusing on mobile devices and HTML5 video special capabilities. Videogular brings to you these key features:

* **Bindable properties**: Videogular's directives are bindable, just [try the demo](http://www.videogular.com) and play with bindings.
* **Extendable through plugins**: Thanks to our API you can develop your own plugins.
* **Theme based**: Customize it with your own themes and change between them on the fly.
* **Native fullscreen support**: Enjoy with native fullscreen support for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, iOS and Chrome for Android.
* **Mobile support**: Videogular can detect mobile devices to show/hide components in case that aren't supported. Also, you could use it in your responsive websites, Videogular will always scale to fit its container.
